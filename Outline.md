# Deep Sea Adventure Overview

## Components
* Player Pawns
* Global Oxygen board & counter (25 “Breaths”)
* Dice (RNG) - 2 d3s
* Treasure Tokens
  * Level 1: Triangular, 0-3 points (2 each)
  * Level 2: Square, 4-7 points (2 each)
  * Level 3: Pentagonal, 8-11 points (2 each)
  * Level 4: Hexagonal, 12-15 points (2 each)

## Set-up
* Assign players through choosing colors
* Set oxygen counter to full
* Randomize treasure tokens within depth class
* 4 groups never mixed

## Game Play
* 3 Rounds
* Each round comprised of continuous player turns
* Player Turn
  * Oxygen check
    * If treasure tokens (tt), decrease oxygen by # of tt.
    * Else, bypass
    * Delve or Return Decision
  * Roll dice
  * Move spots = dice role - tt, skip occupied spots
  * Treasure Decision:
    * If treasure token, choose whether to pick-up
    * If empty spot && treasure in possession, choose whether to drop-off token
  * Check for return to ship. If true, cache treasure tokens and remove from turn rotation, if false, continue on
  * End of turn: if oxygen level ≥ 1, next players turn, else end of the round
* Round End:
  * Reveal and count treasure and add to previous rounds score
  * Players that didn’t make it back:  In order, starting from the Diver closest to the Submarine, players stack their Treasure Chips (in any order they choose) next to the last Chip in the line of Undersea Chips. Once 3 Chips have been stacked, the next Chip begins a new stack at the end of the line. These stacks now function as a single Treasure Chip in subsequent dives. All Chips in a stack should be picked up, placed, and dropped together. They are also treated as a single Chip when calculating air consumption and movement
  * If # of rounds played ≤ play one more round, else game end
  * If new round, furthest from ship or last to return to ship is first player in the next round
  * Reset set-up
  * If game over, declare the player with the highest score as the winner, if tied, the player with the most high-level Treasure Chips is the winner. If this doesn't break the tie, the game ends in a draw.
